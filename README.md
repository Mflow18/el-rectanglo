# el-rectanglo

Good morning every one, here is a test done for VRR in order to see what one can do in a small amount of time.
Please feel free to run first rectangle-bot.rb and let yourself be driven by our friendly bot's messages.
Then, have fun and play using rectangle.rb :
Enter : ruby rectangle.rb followed by 3 integers, like this :
$ ruby rectangle.rb 3 3 2
First is for the length, second for the heigth, last one for styling. We have 3 stylings at the moment, so don't try to do more (wink wink)
Have fun !
